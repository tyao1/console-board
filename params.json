Used internally in LogList.\r\n\r\n`injectRender` Helper function to render the LogList only on development \r\n\r\n\r\n## Why\r\nSometimes the developer console is not available to use, and logging becoming tedious.\r\nAnd some logging options provide plain text output which is not joyful to work with.\r\n\r\n## Use cases\r\n- When the page is in a webview where no remote debugging is available \r\n- When developing React Native apps and turning on remote debugging is too slow\r\n- When you are tired of the default console output\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- [x] Proxy `console` on Chrome and Safari\r\n- [x] Maintain states\r\n- [x] React component\r\n- [x] Accurate output for complex structure\r\n- [x] Interactive\r\n- [ ] Persistence\r\n- [ ] React Native component\r\n- [ ] Plain JS component\r\n",
