# console-board
[WIP] Display all console output in real html

## Why
Sometimes the developer console is not available to use, and logging becoming tedious.
And some logging options provide plain text output which is not joyful to work with.

## Use cases
- When the page is in a webview where no remote debugging is available 
- When developing React Native apps and turning on remote debugging is too slow
- When you are tired of the default console output

## TODO
- [x] Proxy `console` on Chrome and Safari
- [ ] Maintain states
- [ ] React component
- [ ] Accurate output for complex structure
- [ ] Interactive
- [ ] Persistence
- [ ] React Native component
- [ ] Plain JS component
